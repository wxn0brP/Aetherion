# Aetherion

Aetherion is a full-screen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor with a futuristic, sci-fi aesthetic.

## Overview

Inspired by the legacy of the now-archived [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui), Aetherion aims to provide a modern and visually rich interface for system interaction. It combines a functional terminal with real-time monitoring of system resources, presented in a highly stylized, cyberpunk-inspired dashboard.

Aetherion is a Work-In-Progress (WIP) project within the Zhiva ecosystem. Currently, it primarily features an interactive welcome process, setting the stage for the main application functionality which is under active development.

## Installation

To install Aetherion, use the Zhiva CLI:

```bash
zhiva install Aetherion
```
